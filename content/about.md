i'm currently employed by paychex as a software engineer 2, and i'm also the co-founder of dominguez russell software, llc. i love messing with terminal workflows and writing performant applications for whatever needs arise in my day to day. 
  
when i'm not writing code, you might find me volunteering at my parish with my wife, or hanging out with some friends discussing philosophy and solving the world's problems.
